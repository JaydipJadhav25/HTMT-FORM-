HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders for users. HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, which are used to define different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more. HTML5 is the latest version of the language, offering new features and improved semantics, making it easier to create and maintain web applications. It's a fundamental skill for web developers and a crucial aspect of building a website.
